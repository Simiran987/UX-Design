<li>Enjoyable - To make a positive connection between the user and the product.</li>
<li>Useful - The rpoduct should solve a problem.</li>
</ul>

## Why is UX important?
In 2018, the research firm McKinsey & Company studied companies in three industries: medical technology, consumer goods, and retail banking. They found that, regardless of industry, businesses that focused on good usability and design performed better than their competitors.
Basically, it comes down to this: When people like a product, they use that product a lot, and they recommended it to their friends. And more people using the product means better business for the company. Plus, when users have a good experience with the product, they're more likely to have a positive opinion of the company that made it. A win-win for the user and the business.
