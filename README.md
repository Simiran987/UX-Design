# UX-Design

## For a user to have a good experience
A product needs to be - 
<ul>
  <li>Usable - The design, structure and purpose of the product are clear to everyone.</li>
  <li>Equitable - The designs are useful and marketable to people with diverse abilities and backgrounds.</li>
  <li>Enjoyable - To make a positive connection between the user and the product.</li>
  <li>Useful - The rpoduct should solve a problem.</li>
</ul>

## Why is UX important?
In 2018, the research firm McKinsey & Company studied companies in three industries: medical technology, consumer goods, and retail banking. They found that, regardless of industry, businesses that focused on good usability and design performed better than their competitors.<br>
Basically, it comes down to this: When people like a product, they use that product a lot, and they recommended it to their friends. And more people using the product means better business for the company. Plus, when users have a good experience with the product, they're more likely to have a positive opinion of the company that made it. A win-win for the user and the business.

## Fields of UX design
<ul>
  <li><h3>Interaction designers</h4> They focus on designing the experience of a product and how it functions.<br>
    An interaction designer's work answers questions like: What should happen if a user taps on this button? How do we make this action easier for users to complete? And, how are the design elements within the website laid out? Interaction designers focus less on how the product looks and instead strive to make the product easy to navigate and simple for users to interact with.</li>
  <li><h3>Visual designers</h3> They focus on how the product or technology looks.<br>
    The role of a visual designer is to answer questions like: What kind of visual style should icons have, in order to fit the product's branding? Or, which color and font should we use for this button? The goal of a visual designer is to delight users with designs that inspire, engage, and excite them.
  </li>
  <li><h3>Motion designers</h3> They think about what it feels like for a user to move through a product.<br>
    A motion designer’s work answers questions like: How should an app transition between pages? How do we show the connection between these actions? And, what’s an engaging animation that will help tell our story? Motion designers focus on design elements that move, rather than traditional static designs.
  </li>
</ul>
